Day 1 of Pekan development.

Pekan is a game engine that I've had in mind for a couple of years now.
In that time I've researched and learned many topics related to game engine development,
done many small projects implementing different graphics concepts and developed a few games.

Last year I started writing a game engine and called it Pecan (spelled with a C).
As reference I used
- Game Engine tutorials by The Cherno on YouTube
- learnopengl.com
It was going fairly well but some months later I abandoned it for a couple of reasons:
- I hadn't planned the architecture well enough, code had begun to become tangled.
- I was not happy with my choice of GUI framework - Qt.
- I was following The Cherno's tutorials too closely. I want to design and build it my way.

This year I will do another attempt at making my dream game engine.
I'm calling it Pekan (spelled with a K) so that it differs from the previous version - Pecan,
and because Pekan has a more distinctive look to it.

With that, let Pekan development officially begin!
