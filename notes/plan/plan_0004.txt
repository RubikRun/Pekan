Finished the 2 demos:
- Demo02 - a scene with a 3D cube, together with GUI controls for rotation, colors, etc.
- Demo03 - snake game
Meanwhile I fixed some minor bugs in Pekan.

Now I have a better idea of what Pekan needs for v0.2.
Here's a list of features to start working on:
1. Event system
    - A way for applications to ask Pekan
        "Is this key pressed at the moment?"
        "Is this mouse button pressed at the moment?"
        "How much is mouse scrolling at the moment?"
        "What is the mouse position at the moment?"
        "What is the current window resolution?"
    - A way for applications to attach a callback function for
        when a key is pressed
        when a mouse button is pressed
        when mouse scroll is used
        when mouse changes position
        when window is resized
2. Layering system
    Scenes and GUIWindows should be "layers".
    Applications should be able to compose multiple layers, determining which ones are drawn on top.
    Applications should be able to determine which events should be catched by which layers,
    so for example clicking on a GUI layer shouldn't propagate to the scene layer behind.
3. Batch Rendering
4. Limit FPS
    Create a way for applications to specify a limiting framerate
5. Control window's title
    Create a way for applications to specify the window's title
6. RenderObject wrapper
    Create a wrapper of vertex buffer, index buffer, vertex array, and shader.
    Similar to the one done in Demo03
7. Wrappers for 2D shapes
    Triangle, Rectangle, Square, Line, Circle
8. Textures
    Add support for textures in PekanRenderer
