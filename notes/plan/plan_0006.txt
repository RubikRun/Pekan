Finished work on Gleam House for now.
Pekan v0.2 feels quite stable, but very limited in terms of functionality.
Gathered "user feedback" from myself, for what Pekan needs for v0.3
A lot of features had to be implemented in Gleam House. Features that are engine logic and can be part of Pekan. 

Here's a list of features needed for v0.3:
1. Entity Component System
2. A file format for scenes
3. Transitioning between layers
4. Collision detection in 2D
5. Lights in 2D
6. Debug Overlay
