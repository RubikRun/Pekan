Now that we have all technologies setup,
I want Pekan to have a Playground for implementing whatever
with the technologies that it supports.

I want to play around with OpenGL and ImGui,
implementing some random game engine concepts,
and having them all within Pekan Playground.

We should be able to easily disable Pekan Playground in CMake
and have it enabled only in dev builds.
