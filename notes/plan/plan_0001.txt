Now that we have all technologies setup,
I want Pekan to have a Playground for implementing whatever
with the technologies that it supports.

I want to play around with OpenGL and ImGui,
implementing some random game engine concepts,
and having them all within Pekan Playground.

We should be able to easily disable Pekan Playground in CMake
and have it enabled only in dev builds.

It's me from the future.
Decided to not have a "playground" exactly but just Demo projects.
They will be grouped together in a virtual folder called Demos,
and you'd be able to disable them from CMake,
so that Demo projects are not generated for a release build, for example.
