Pekan v0.2 is finished.
Now I will spend some time building an actual game with Pekan,
to see how it behaves in a real use case, how it feels to use it, get some ideas on what to improve
and what to implement next, find some bugs, etc.

The game will be called
    Gleam House
and it will be in a separate repository.
