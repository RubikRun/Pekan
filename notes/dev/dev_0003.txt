Today in Demo02 I implemented a basic 3D scene with a rotating cube.
Initially every side of the cube was a different fixed size.
Now I made it so that the 6 colors of the 6 sides can be controlled with 6 colors controls in GUI.

Also changed GUI's scale because everything felt a bit small.
I scaled up font size and widgets size.

Added a slider for cube's rotation, instead of animating the rotation over time.
