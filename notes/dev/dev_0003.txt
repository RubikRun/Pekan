Today in Demo02 I implemented a basic 3D scene with a rotating cube.
Initially every side of the cube was a different fixed size.
Now I made it so that the 6 colors of the 6 sides can be controlled with 6 colors controls in GUI.

Also changed GUI's scale because everything felt a bit small.
I scaled up font size and widgets size.

Added a slider for cube's rotation, instead of animating the rotation over time.
Added a slider for camera's FOV (field of view) angle.
Added a slider for camera's distance to center.

Demo02 is done.

For Demo03 I want to create the classic snake game.
It will not have any GUI, and I want it to be full-screen.
Currently we don't support applications without GUI, which is stupid tbh, let's change it.
In PekanApplication we should allow both applications without GUI and applications without a scene.
