Officially starting work on v0.2.
Let's follow the list of features in
    plan_0004.txt

{
Let's tart with the event system. That's a big one.
I will use the following commits from Hazel Engine as reference.
    https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/commit/34df41651fe88041540f20df845a70642359dc17
    https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/commit/30516ad7109b016213eb732f14e1c7061c1db603

As a first step I will copy most of it, and just integrate it into Pekan,
to see how it works and to see if I like it.

Let's create a new directory
    Events
under
    src/PekanCore
Inside of it create the following header files
    WindowEvent.h
    Event.h
    KeyEvent.h
    MouseEvent.h
Add them to project PekanCore in the root CMake file.
Now I will copy code from the corresponding files in this Hazel commit
    https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/commit/34df41651fe88041540f20df845a70642359dc17
and integrate it into Pekan.
Done.
