{
Before actually implementing Pekan Playground,
I will start immediately playing around with OpenGL and ImGui
directly inside of project Pekan.

TODO: After implementing the Playground refactor and move whatever I've done in project Pekan into the Playground
}

{
What I want to do today, as an exercise in OpenGL and ImGui is the following:
--begin EXERCISE0000 DESC
    Pekan starts with an empty graphics window and a GUI window containing only a single "+" button.
    When user clicks the "+" button, a new white square of size 0.2 is spawned at (0, 0),
    together with GUI controls for that square's size, position, rotation and color.
    User is able to spawn as many squares as they want and arrange them however they want.
--end EXERCISE0000 DESC
}
