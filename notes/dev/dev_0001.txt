Before actually implementing Pekan Playground,
I will start immediately playing around with OpenGL and ImGui
directly inside of project Pekan.

TODO: After implementing the Playground refactor and move whatever I've done in project Pekan into the Playground
}

{
What I want to do, as an exercise in OpenGL and ImGui is the following:
--begin EXERCISE0000 DESC
    Pekan starts with an empty graphics window and a GUI window containing only a single "+" button.
    When user clicks the "+" button, a new white square of size 0.2 is spawned at (0, 0),
    together with GUI controls for that square's size, position, rotation and color.
    User is able to spawn as many squares as they want and arrange them however they want.
--end EXERCISE0000 DESC
}

{
Let's start from somewhere.
Let's refactor the OpenGL demo into a class
    SquaresScene
having these 3 functions
    bool init();
    void render();
    void cleanup();

Now let's do something similar for ImGui.
Let's refactor the ImGui demo into a class
    SquaresGui
There's no real need for SquaresGui to be a class for now because we need only 1 static function
    static void render(GLFWwindow* window, ImVec4& clearColor);
but that's okay, I'll leave it as a class, because we might need it to have some local data later.

Let's also create a class
    PekanEngine
which will be the engine itself.
And let's refactor initialization and cleanup of libraries to be there inside of that class.
We can also put the whole running of demos there, for now, in this function
    bool runExercise0000() const;

}

{
Let's stop refactoring now, and actually implement something from exercise0000.
Let's begin by adding a single "+" button in GUI,
that when clicked adds a new square on a random position somewhere inside the window.
Done.

Now let's add dynamic controls in GUI for controlling the position and size of each new square.
When the button is pressed we want a new square AND a new set of GUI controls to appear.
Done.

{
First thing I'll do today is to redesign the GUI from last time a little bit.
I want the X and Y sliders to be on the same row.
Also fixed some padding and adaptive width issues.

Next, I want to add control for a square's rotation.
Since we're in 2D a rotation can be represented with a single number, so a single slider in GUI.

Today I want to add control for each square's color.
Done.
