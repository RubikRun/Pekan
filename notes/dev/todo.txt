0000 18.02.2024 (TODO): Add "m_" prefix to all private member variables
0001 18.02.2024 (TODO): Add comments on class PekanEngine and class PekanRenderer
0002 23.02.2024 (TODO): Create a base class RenderingComponent with common functions and variables
                        between different OpenGL objects, for example Shader, VertexBuffer, VertexArray, etc.
                        All of them need to have create(), destroy(), bind(), unbind(), isValid(), id, etc.
0003 23.02.2024 (TODO): Provide optional parameter of create() function of VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer
                        for the value that is currently hardcoded as GL_STATIC_DRAW
0004 24.02.2024 (TODO): Wrap all OpenGL calls in an OpenGL error-checking macro
0005 24.02.2024 (DONE): In class PekanRenderer make all non-client functions be private, and allow usage for internal classes with "friend" keyword.
0006 24.02.2024 (TODO): Do some error-checking in most functions in OpenGL wrapper classes. Mostly check isValid() and bind().
                        Think about whether we want to do these checks in every function (secure, but may cost performance)
