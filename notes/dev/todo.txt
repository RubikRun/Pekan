0000 18.02.2025 (DONE): Add "m_" prefix to all private member variables

0001 18.02.2025 (DONE): Add comments on class PekanEngine and class PekanRenderer

0002 23.02.2025 (DONE): Create a base class RenderComponent with common functions and variables
                        between different OpenGL objects, for example Shader, VertexBuffer, VertexArray, etc.
                        All of them need to have create(), destroy(), bind(), unbind(), isValid(), id, etc.

0003 23.02.2025 (DONE): Provide optional parameter of create() function of VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer
                        for the value that is currently hardcoded as GL_STATIC_DRAW

0004 24.02.2025 (DONE): Wrap all OpenGL calls in an OpenGL error-checking macro

0005 24.02.2025 (DONE): In class PekanRenderer make all non-client functions be private, and allow usage for internal classes with "friend" keyword.

0006 24.02.2025 (DONE): Do some error-checking in most functions in OpenGL wrapper classes. Mostly check isValid() and bind().
                        Think about whether we want to do these checks in every function (secure, but may cost performance)

0007 01.03.2025 (DONE): Do we need to keep m_window as member of PekanGUIWindow when we already have a static s_window in PekanEngine?

0008 04.03.2025 (DONE): Add support for line numbers in log messages in PekanLogger

0009 19.03.2025 (TODO): Add option for changing window's title in applications

0010 20.03.2025 (TODO): Limit FPS

0011 21.03.2025 (TODO): Event system

0012 21.03.2025 (TODO): Provide a way for applications ot specify their way of closing

0013 25.03.2025 (TODO): In Demo03 see what happens if window is resized during gameplay. My guess is snake's squares will not remain square.
                        Make them respond dynamically to window's resolution.
