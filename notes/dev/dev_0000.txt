Let's begin by setting up a CMake project.

We need a
    CMakeLists.txt
file in the root directory.
For now we'll have a single project called
    Pekan
All source code will be under directory
    src
Source code for project Pekan will be under
    src/Pekan
Let's create a single source file there
    main.cpp
In CMake we can make project Pekan compile into an executable using that source file.
    add_executable(Pekan src/Pekan/main.cpp)

Now we can configure project and generate a Visual Studio solution
    cmake -B build
Then we can open Visual Studio solution, build it and run it.

All files generated under directory
    build
should not be commited to Git, so let's add that directory to
    .gitignore
}

{
Generated Visual Studio solution has 4 configurations available, I want only 2
    Release, Debug
so let's make CMake generate a solution with only those 2
    set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES "Debug;Release")
}

{
I want to use C++ 17, so let's set this as a requirement in CMake.
}

{
When CMake generates a fresh new Visual Studio solution,
the startup project by default is ALL_BUILD.
I want the startup project to be Pekan.
We can achieve this in CMake 3.6 and above, like that:
    set_property(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} PROPERTY VS_STARTUP_PROJECT Pekan)
}
